## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Smoking Tracker does not use servers or store any data online
- All user data remains locally on the device, which minimizes security risks

If you believe you have found a security issue (e.g., related to data storage, app permissions, or dependency vulnerabilities), please report it by opening a new **GitHub Issue** in this repository

### What to Expect
- Clearly describe the issue and steps to reproduce it
- Label the issue with `security`
- We aim to respond within **72 hours**
- If confirmed, the issue will be fixed in the next stable release
